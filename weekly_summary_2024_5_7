# Weekly Summary 2024-5-7
We tried more tests. We found: In "CTBRcontroller.py"-"update", we use the quaternion to change the coordinate system to the drone itself to calculate torque and collective thrust. And finally, we use matrix inv_A to change the coordinate system to Isaac Gym to set force and torque on the rigid body. There is no issue with this code when the drone is in a horizontal position. But when the drone is tilted, the collective thrust should be decomposed into three forces in the x-y-z direction, not only 1 force in z direction. In the current code, we only have an upward thrust when we set "apply_rigid_body_force_tensors", so it is difficult for the drone to handle horizontal tasks such as flying forward and right.
